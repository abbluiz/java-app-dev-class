package lab07;/*
 * (Count the occurrences of numbers entered)
 * Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occurrences.
 * The input ends when the input is 0.
 * For example, if you entered 2 3 40 3 5 4 ï¿½3 3 3 2 0, the number 3 occurred most often.
 * If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported.
 * For example, since 9 and 3 appear twice in the list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.
 *
 * Hint #1: Use map to store the number occurrences for each integer.
 * Hint #2: Use values() method from Collection interface to return values as a Collection object.
 * Hint #3: Use max() static method from Collections class to find the maximum value.
 * Hint #4: Use keySet() method from Map interface to returns all keys as a Set object.
